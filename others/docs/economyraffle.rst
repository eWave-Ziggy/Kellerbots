EconomyRaffle
===============

A simple cog that gives a pre-specified amount of credits to a randomly picked user.

.. tip:: I suggest using it along with
    `scheduler <https://github.com/mikeshardmind/SinbadCogs>`__.

``[p]`` is your prefix, ``<>`` is a required argument, ``[]`` is an optional argument.

------------
Setting up
------------

Simply run 

.. code-block:: none

    [p]economysetup

The bot will then proceed to ask you a series of questions where you choose 
whether your winner should have a specified role, how much they get and what the message is.

After that, either set scheduler or just run 

.. code-block:: none

    [p]economyraffle
