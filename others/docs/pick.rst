Pick
===============

Pick a random user or a user with a specified role. 

.. warning:: Output is user ID.

.. tip:: I suggest using it along with
    `nestedcommands <https://github.com/tmercswims/tmerc-cogs>`__ and
    `scheduler <https://github.com/mikeshardmind/SinbadCogs>`__.

``[p]`` is your prefix, ``<>`` is a required argument, ``[]`` is an optional argument.

------------
Setting up
------------

If you do not wish to have your picked member to have a certain role,
you don't need to set anything up! Otherwise, run 

.. code-block:: none

    [p]pickrole <role>

to set the role.
